# 1BRC

run `python create_measurements.py NUMBER` to make a measurement file with NUMBER rows, the challenge is to make one with 1 billion rows and parse it as fast as you can.

You need to find the min, mean, and max of each station. 

Feel free to use whatever library, but it's also cool to make a solution only using std.

All solutions will be run on a fat server later.
